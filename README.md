# Adaptive Agent Framework

This project provides a Python-based framework for developing adaptive agents. These agents can process input, modify their behavior based on experience, and reflect on their operational history. It's designed to be a foundational toolkit for experimenting with concepts of programmatic adaptation and introspection.

## Core Components

The framework is built around a few key components:

*   **`IntrospectiveState`**: Manages the agent's internal state, including its history of interactions and a simulated 'emotional valence'. It provides a basis for the agent to understand its own operations.
*   **`AdaptiveLoop`**: Contains the logic for how the agent adapts to new inputs. In the current implementation, it performs simple transformations on the input data based on the agent's state.
*   **`ReflectiveProcessor`**: Enables the agent to reflect on its history and state. It generates summaries or insights based on past activities.
*   **`AdaptiveAgent`**: The central class that orchestrates the interactions between the state, adaptation, and reflection components. It processes incoming data and returns the agent's response.

## Running the Simulation

A simple command-line simulation is provided in `simulation.py` to demonstrate the agent's functionality.

To run the simulation:

1.  Ensure you have Python installed.
2.  Install the necessary dependencies (primarily NumPy):
    ```bash
    pip install numpy
    ```
3.  Navigate to the project directory and run the simulation script:
    ```bash
    python simulation.py
    ```

You should see output demonstrating the agent processing various inputs, adapting to them, and reflecting on its actions. Each step will show the processed context, the reflection generated, and the agent's meta-state.

## Dependencies

The core functionality of this framework relies on:

*   **NumPy**: For numerical operations, particularly within the `AdaptiveLoop` and `IntrospectiveState`.

The project also includes a `requirements.txt` file that lists other optional dependencies for development, testing, and potential extensions (e.g., web APIs, machine learning experiments, documentation generation). You can install all core and major optional dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## How to Use

This framework can be used as a starting point for building more sophisticated adaptive systems. Here are a few ways you might use or extend it:

*   **Customize Adaptation Logic**: Modify the `AdaptiveLoop` class to implement more complex adaptation strategies. This could involve machine learning models, different types of data transformations, or interactions with external knowledge bases.
*   **Enhance Introspection**: Extend `IntrospectiveState` to capture more detailed information about the agent's performance, decision-making processes, or environmental factors.
*   **Develop New Reflective Processes**: Create new `ReflectiveProcessor` implementations that generate different kinds of insights, such as identifying patterns in behavior, suggesting improvements, or summarizing key events.
*   **Integrate with External Systems**: Use the `AdaptiveAgent` as a component in larger applications. For instance, you could integrate it into a chatbot, a robotic control system, or a data processing pipeline.
*   **Experiment with Different Inputs**: The current `simulation.py` uses basic data types. You can adapt the agent to handle more complex inputs like sensor data, natural language text, or structured information.
