# Adaptive Cognitive Framework

The Adaptive Cognitive Framework is a Python-based simulation of an advanced, autonomous, context-aware agent. The system features:

- **Recursive Self-Improvement:** The agent evaluates its performance and modifies strategies accordingly.
- **Introspective Feedback Loop:** Ongoing analysis of internal states and meta-contextual awareness.
- **Dynamic Context Processing:** Adapts reasoning based on changing environments and data.
- **Ethical Alignment Layer:** Ensures decisions adhere to defined safety and alignment checks.

This framework serves as a starting point for researchers and enthusiasts interested in building systems with autonomous adaptation and advanced context processing capabilities.

## Features

- Autonomous agent core
- Introspection and reflection modules
- Adaptive learning mechanism
- Simulation runner for experiments

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOURUSERNAME/adaptive-cognitive-framework.git
